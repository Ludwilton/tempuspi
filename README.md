# TempusPi

An always on low power Raspberry Pi zero 2 w, Waveshare e-ink dashboard that displays real-time weather, calendar events, public transit departures, and currently playing Spotify music.

It fetches data from multiple APIs and renders them as a clean, customizable HTML dashboard optimized for e-paper displays.
